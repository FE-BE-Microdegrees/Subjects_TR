# Front-End Technologies

**"Front-end Technologies"** provides an immersive exploration into the tools, techniques, and best practices that drive today's web interfaces. This subject introduces students to the trinity of web development: HTML for content structure, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic behavior. With a blend of theory and hands-on practice, students will undertake projects that challenge them to design and code web pages and applications that are both visually appealing and functionally robust. This course serves as a gateway to the fast-evolving domain of web development and user experience design.
## Description

- **Volume**: 4 ECTS (4 x 26 hours)
- **Subject Aims**: The aim of the "Front-end Technologies" subject is to equip students with the skills and knowledge required to design and develop interactive, user-friendly, and responsive web interfaces.

By the end of the course, students should be proficient in key front-end technologies, understand the principles of web design, and be capable of creating modern web interfaces that cater to diverse user needs and devices.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Foundational Knowledge**: Understand the core principles and purposes of the trinity of web development: HTML (structure), CSS (presentation), and JavaScript (behavior).
- **HTML Proficiency**: Demonstrate the ability to use HTML to structure web content semantically, incorporating elements such as links, images, forms, and multimedia.
- **CSS Proficiency**: Apply CSS for styling and layout, utilizing techniques such as the box model, flexbox, and grid systems to create responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes and devices.
- **JavaScript Proficiency**: Implement basic scripting with JavaScript to add interactivity, handle user input, and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM).
- **Responsive Design**: Design and develop web interfaces that are mobile-friendly and adapt to varying screen resolutions using responsive design techniques.
- **User Experience (UX) Principles**: Recognize the importance of user experience principles in front-end design and apply basic heuristics for creating user-friendly interfaces.
- **Web Accessibility**: Develop web interfaces that are accessible to users with disabilities, applying guidelines from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
