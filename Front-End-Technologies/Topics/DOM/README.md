## What is the DOM?

Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript. The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.
