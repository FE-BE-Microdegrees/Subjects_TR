## What is the purpose of this course?

The purpose of this course is to get acquainted with the world of programming. We will learn the basics of programming, how to plan and write code using JavaScript.

This course lays the foundation for `Front-End` and `Back-End` development. It helps understand the basics and concepts of programming. This course is intended for those who wish to learn programming and software development but have not previously been exposed to programming.

## What is programming and why is it important?

Programming is the process of writing instructions for a computer to perform tasks. These instructions are written in a programming language, which is a formal language that can be translated into **machine code** (i.e., binary) and executed by a computer.
Programming is a creative process that involves designing **algorithms** and developing **code** to solve problems. It is a skill that is highly valued in today's digital world, and it is also a skill that can be learned by anyone.

## What we will learn in this course?

In this course, we will learn the basics of programming. We will learn about:
- [Variables](https://github.com/FE-BE-Microdegrees/Subjects/blob/Translate/Programming-Basics/Topics/Variables/README.md);
- [Data types](https://github.com/FE-BE-Microdegrees/Subjects/blob/Translate/Programming-Basics/Topics/Data-Types/README.md);
- Control structures
- [Operators and expressions](https://github.com/FE-BE-Microdegrees/Subjects/blob/Translate/Programming-Basics/Topics/Operators/README.md)
- [Loops](https://github.com/FE-BE-Microdegrees/Subjects/blob/Translate/Programming-Basics/Topics/Loops/README.md)
- [Functions](https://github.com/FE-BE-Microdegrees/Subjects/blob/Translate/Programming-Basics/Topics/Functions/README.md)
- [Developing simple algorithms](https://github.com/FE-BE-Microdegrees/Subjects/blob/Translate/Programming-Basics/Topics/Algorithms/README.md)

We will learn how to write and debug our first lines of code, paving the way for more advanced studies in software development and computer science.

## Which language will we use?

There are lot of different programming languages out there, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of them are considered easier to learn than others, while some are more powerful and flexible. For this course, we will use JavaScript, which is a popular programming language that is used for both front-end and back-end development. It is not considered as a best language to learn programming, but this course is all about web development and nowaday JavaScript is a must-have skill for web developers.

## What tools will we use?

Just like any job requires tools, so does programming. We will use various tools and applications to write, run, manage, and store our code.

Our main tools are:

- Code editor
- [Node.js](https://github.com/FE-BE-Microdegrees/Subjects/blob/Translate/Programming-Basics/Topics/NodeJS/README.md)
- Browser
- Git
- [Github](https://github.com/)
- ...

We will talk about the tools we use as we move along with the topics.

## Questions

- Have you previously encountered programming?
- What programming languages have you heard of before?
