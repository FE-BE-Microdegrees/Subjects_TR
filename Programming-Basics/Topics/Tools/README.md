# Tools

In this topic, we'll learn about tools that we'll be using during this course.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this topic, you'll be able to:
- Explain what a code editor is
- Explain what a browser is
- Explain what a terminal is
- Explain what Git is
- Explain what GitHub is
- Explain what GitHub Desktop is

## Code Editor

A code editor is a program that is used to write and edit source code. There are many different code editors available, but the most popular ones are:
- Visual Studio Code
- Sublime Text
- Atom
- etc.

Technically, we could write code using regular text editors, but code editors have many features that make it easier to write code, such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and code folding.

During this course, we'll be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as our code editor, but everyone can use whichever code editor they prefer. Visual Studio Code is a free and open-source code editor that is developed by Microsoft. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux and it has many features that make it a great choice for beginners.

## Browser

A browser is a program that is used to view web pages. There are many different browsers available, but the most popular ones are: 
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge

During this course, we'll be using [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as our browser, but again, everyone can use whichever browser they prefer.

## Terminal

A terminal is a program that is used to interact with the operating system. It is also known as a command-line interface (CLI) or a shell. There are many different terminals available, but the most popular ones are: 
- Windows Terminal
- iTerm2
- Hyper
- etc

During this course, we'll be using Visual Studio Code's built-in terminal, but everyone can use whichever terminal they prefer. We use terminals to run commands that perform various tasks, such as creating files, installing packages, and running programs.

## Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system that is used to track changes in files and folders. It is a distributed version control system, which means that every developer has a copy of the entire project on their computer. We can use Git from the command line or from a GUI (graphical user interface).
During this course, we'll be using Git to track changes in our projects and to collaborate with other developers.

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://www.github.com) is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It is a platform that allows developers to collaborate on projects and share code with each other. It is also a social network for developers, where they can follow each other, like each other's projects, and comment on each other's projects. During this course, we'll be using GitHub to host our projects and to collaborate with other developers.

## GitHub Desktop

As mentioned above, we can use Git from the command line or from a GUI. During this course, we'll be using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) as our Git GUI, but everyone can use whichever Git GUI they prefer. GitHub Desktop is a free and open-source Git GUI that is developed by GitHub. It is available for Windows and Mac and it has many features that make it a great choice for beginners.

There will be a separate topic on Git and GitHub later in this course, where we'll learn how to use Git and GitHub to track changes in our projects and to collaborate with other developers.

Also there will be more tools that we'll be using during this course, but we'll learn about them as we go along.
