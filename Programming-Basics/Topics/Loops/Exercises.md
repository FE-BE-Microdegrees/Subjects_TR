## Exercise 1: Counting Even and Odd Numbers

**Task:** Use a `while` loop to print all numbers in the range from `1` to `10` to the console. If the number is even, add the word `Even` next to the number; if it is odd, add the word `Odd`.

**Expected Result:**

```bash
1 Odd
2 Even
3 Odd
4 Even
5 Odd
6 Even
7 Odd
8 Even
9 Odd
10 Even
```

## Exercise 2: Repeating Letters

**Task:** Write a program that uses a `for` loop to print each letter from the word "Hello!" on a new line, repeating each letter according to its index number.

**Expected Result:**

```bash
H
ee
lll
llll
ooooo
!!!!!!
```

## Exercise 3: Factorial of a Number

**Task:** Declare a variable `number` with a positive integer value. Use a `while` or `for` loop to find and print the factorial of this number. The factorial is the product of numbers in the range from 1 to n and is denoted by n!. For example, 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

**Example:** 
```javascript
let number = 5;
```
```bash
120
```
## Exercise 4: Counting Numbers Backwards

**Task:** Use a `do-while` loop to print the numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order.

**Expected Result:**

```bash
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
```
## Exercise 5: First N Elements of the Fibonacci Sequence

**Task:** Write a program that generates and prints the first N elements of the Fibonacci sequence, where N is a given positive integer. The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. For example, `0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34`.

**Example:** `let N = 6;`

**Expected Result:**

```bash
0 1 1 2 3 5
```
