# Additional Exercises for Conditional Statements

If you have completed the exercises in the learning materials but want to practice more, here are some additional exercises you can try. These exercises will help you practice using conditional statements in various scenarios.

## Exercise 1: Season Checker

Declare a variable `numberOfMonth` and assign it the value of the month number (1 for January to 12 for December). Then write conditional statements that check the month number and print to the console which season corresponds to the given month. Use the following distribution:

- Winter - December (12), January (1), February (2);
- Spring - March (3), April (4), May (5);
- Summer - June (6), July (7), August (8);
- Fall - September (9), October (10), November (11).

```javascript
let numberOfMonth = 3; // Change this number to test different months
// Add logic here to check the season and output the result

```
### Exercise 2: Identifying User Age Group

Declare a variable `age` and assign it the user's age. Write a program that identifies which age group the user belongs to and prints it to the console. The age groups are as follows:

- Child - under 13;
- Teenager - 13 to 19;
- Adult - 20 to 65;
- Senior - over 65.

```javascript
let age = 25; // Change this value to test different ages

// Add logic here to identify the age group and output the result

```
### Exercise 3: Estimated Travel Time

Declare variables `distance` (distance in kilometers) and `traffic` (traffic condition, with the following possible values: "normal", "heavy", "very heavy"). Write a program that calculates the estimated travel time based on the distance and traffic condition, and prints the time in hours to the console.

```javascript
let distance = 120; // Change this number to test different distances
let traffic = "heavy"; // Change this to test different traffic conditions

// Add logic here to calculate the estimated travel time and output the result

```

## Exercise 4: Ticket Price Based on Age and Day

Declare variables `age` and `weekday`. Write a program that calculates the movie ticket price based on the user's age (`age`) and the day of the week (`weekday`) and prints the price to the console. Ticket prices are as follows:

- An adult ticket on a weekday is 10 euros, on the weekend 12 euros;
- Children's and seniors' tickets are always 6 euros, regardless of the day of the week.

```javascript
let age = 30; // Change this value to test different ages
let weekday = "Saturday"; // Change this to test different weekdays

// Add logic here to calculate the ticket price and output the result
```
