## What is Node JS?

**NodeJS** is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to execute JavaScript code outside of the web browser. NodeJS is a server-side language, meaning it runs on a server and, unlike browser-run JavaScript, NodeJS has access to the computer's filesystem. Access to the filesystem allows NodeJS to read, create, and modify files from the computer's storage devices, which cannot be done with browser-run JavaScript.


## Why Use Node JS?

NodeJS is a popular choice for building web applications because it is fast, scalable, and easy to learn, and it allows using the same language (JavaScript) on both the client and server sides. NodeJS is also popular because it has a large community of developers and a vast number of open-source libraries that can be used to build web applications.

NodeJS's use is not limited to web applications. It can also be used to build: 
- **desktop applications**
- **mobile applications**
-  **IoT** applications.

## How to Install Node JS?

To install NodeJS, you need to download the NodeJS installer from the [official NodeJS website](https://nodejs.org/en/download). The installer will install NodeJS and **NPM** (*Node Package Manager*) on your computer. **NPM** is a tool used to install and manage NodeJS packages.

## How to Run Node JS?

To run Node JS, we need to open a terminal and type `node` followed by the name of the file that we want to run. For example, if we have a file named `index.js`, we can run it by typing `node index.js` in the terminal.

Note that in this way, we can only run files that are located inside the folder opened in our terminal. If we want to run files located elsewhere, we need to navigate to the respective folder in the terminal.
