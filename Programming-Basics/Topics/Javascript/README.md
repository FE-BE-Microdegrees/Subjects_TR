## What is Javascript?

Javascript is a programming language that was originally designed for creating interactive web pages. In the past, Javascript was only used on the client-side (in the web browser, *Front-End*). Nowadays, it is possible to use Javascript on the server-side as well, using NodeJS (*Back-End*). We are using Javascript in this course precisely because it allows us to learn both client and server-side development using the same programming language.

## History of Javascript

**Javascript** was created by Brendan Eich in 1995. Initially, it was named *Mocha*, then renamed to *LiveScript*, and finally, to *Javascript*. The name Javascript was chosen because *Java* was very popular at the time, and the name Javascript was used to attract Java developers to use Javascript.

## Advantages of Javascript

- Javascript is easy to learn
- Javascript is easy to use
- Javascript is very popular
- All major web browsers support Javascript
- Getting started with Javascript is very easy
- You can use Javascript for both client-side and server-side development

## Disadvantages of Javascript

- Javascript is weakly typed, meaning the type of a variable can be changed during the execution of the program
- Javascript is not a compiled language, meaning the code is not compiled before it is executed
- Sometimes the code is hard to understand due to the lack of type information


## How to run Javascript?

There are multiple ways to run Javascript. We can save the Javascript code in a file and run it using Node JS or we can run it in the browser. We can also run Javascript code in the browser console.

## How to write Javascript?

To write Javascript, you can use a simple text editor, but it is recommended to use a specialized code editor that supports Javascript. To write code, you need to create a new file with the `.js` extension and write the code in that file.

```js
console.log('Hello, World!');
```
Then, you need to save the file and then it is possible to execute the written code.

## Running Javascript in Node JS

To run Javascript in Node JS, we need to open the terminal and type node fileName.js in the terminal, where fileName.js is the name of the file containing the Javascript code.
