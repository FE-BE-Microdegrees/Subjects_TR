## What is Hello World?

Usually, when we start learning programming or a new programming language, the first thing that we do is write a program that prints the words "Hello World" to the screen. This is called a "Hello World" program. It is a simple program that is used to demonstrate the basic syntax of a programming language and to make sure that we can run the program on our computer. It is also used to test the development environment and to make sure that everything is working correctly.

In some programming languages (like C), we need to write a lot of code to print the words "Hello World" to the screen. In Javascript, we only need to write one line of code to print the words "Hello World" to the screen.

## How to Write Hello World in Javascript?

In order to write Hello World in Javascript, we need to open a text editor and type the following code:

```javascript
console.log('Hello World!');
```

We can save the file as `helloWorld.js` and run it using Node JS.

`console.log()` is a function that is used to print a message to the console. It takes one argument, which is the message that we want to print to the console. In this case, the message is "Hello World!".

## How to Run Hello World in Javascript?

In order to run Hello World in Javascript, we need to open a terminal and type `node helloWorld.js` in the terminal, where `helloWorld.js` is the name of the file that contains the Hello World program.

Write a program that prints the words "Hello World" to the screen.

Run the program using Node JS.
