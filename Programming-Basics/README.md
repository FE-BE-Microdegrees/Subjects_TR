# Programming Basics

## Description

**"Programming Basics"** serves as an entry point into the world of computer programming. Designed for beginners, this subject covers the fundamental concepts every budding programmer must know. Students will learn about variables, data types, control structures, loops, functions, and basic algorithm development. Through hands-on exercises and projects, students will write and debug their first lines of code, paving the way for more advanced studies in software development and computer science. No prior programming experience is required, making this the ideal starting point for anyone curious about the art and science of programming.

- **Volume**: 4 ECTS (4 x 26 hours)
- **Subject Aims**: The aim of the **"Programming Basics"** subject is to introduce students to the foundational concepts and principles of computer programming.
By the end of the course, students should have a clear understanding of the logical structure of programming, be familiar with basic coding syntax, and be capable of writing simple programs to solve computational problems.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Understand Programming Concepts**: Recognize and explain fundamental programming constructs such as variables, data types, and operators.
- **Control Structures**: Implement basic control structures, including loops (e.g., for, while) and conditionals (e.g., if-else statements), to influence the flow of program execution.
- **Functions and Methods**: Design and utilize functions/methods to modularize and simplify code, understanding the concepts of parameters, return values, and function calls.
- **Basic Algorithms**: Design and implement simple algorithms to solve problems, such as searching for a value in a list or sorting a sequence of numbers.
- **Data Structures**: Understand and employ basic data structures like arrays, lists, and strings to organize and manipulate data.
- **Debugging Skills**: Identify, trace, and resolve basic coding errors (both syntax and logic) using debugging techniques and tools.
- **Problem-solving Skills**: Analyze simple problems and devise computational solutions through algorithmic thinking.
- **Basic Input/Output**: Implement basic input and output operations to interact with users or to read from and write to files.

## Learning Instructions

We will be using Github to share the learning materials and to submit the homework.

Students should follow the order of the topics and lectures. Each topic has a `README` file with the learning materials and exercises. The exercises should be solved and uploaded to Github. The homework should be submitted before the next lecture.

Learning materials for the next lecture should be studied before the lecture (exept for the first lecture). In the lectures we will discuss about the topics and solve exercises regarding the studied topics.
