# Back-End Frameworks

"Back-end Frameworks" offers an in-depth exploration into the methodologies, tools, and best practices pivotal to today's server-side application development. Students will immerse themselves in the core concepts such as routing, middleware, authentication, and database operations. Throughout the course, students will engage in hands-on projects, building performant and secure applications that are ready for deployment in real-world scenarios. This journey will also acquaint them with the extensive toolset and ecosystem intrinsic to modern back-end development.

## Description

- **Volume**: 4 ECTS (4 x 26 hours)
- **Subject Aims**: The aim of the "Back-end Frameworks" subject is to cultivate students' abilities to use modern back-end frameworks for the development of robust, scalable, and secure server-side applications.

By the end of the course, students should be adept at the principles of server architecture, API development, database integration, and the broader ecosystem associated with contemporary back-end development.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Server Architecture**: Understand and implement server architectures, utilizing framework capabilities to structure scalable applications.
- **Routing and Middleware**: Employ routing mechanisms to handle various request types and utilize middleware for request/response processing.
- **Database Integration**: Connect server-side applications to relational and non-relational databases, executing CRUD operations and understanding ORM/ODM paradigms.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement authentication and authorization strategies to secure applications, understanding sessions, tokens, and OAuth mechanisms.
- **API Development**: Design and develop RESTful APIs, emphasizing best practices for endpoint structure, data validation, and error handling.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling strategies to manage and respond to various error types and scenarios.
- **Deployment and Production**: Familiarize with deployment processes, environment configurations, and the nuances of moving a back-end application to production.
- **Security Measures**: Implement various security measures, understanding potential vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, CSRF, and protecting against them.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Understand the CI/CD pipeline and integrate it into the back-end development workflow.
