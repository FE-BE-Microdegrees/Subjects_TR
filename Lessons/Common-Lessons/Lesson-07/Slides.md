## Programming

---

## Modules

---

## Modules - What?

A module is a JavaScript file that contains code that can be reused in other JavaScript files.

Modules are used to organize code into logical units that can be reused throughout the program.

Modules can include functions, objects, classes, variables, and other JavaScript code elements.

---

## Modules - Types

- Self-written modules
- Built-in modules
- Third-party modules

---

## Self-Written Modules

As the name suggests, these are modules we write ourselves to structure and reuse code.

To use self-written modules, they must first be exported and then imported into the relevant file.

---

## Self-Written Modules - Exporting

```javascript
const myModule = {
  myFunction() {
    // function content
  }
}

module.exports = myModule;

```

---

## Self-Written Modules - Importing

```javascript
const myModule = require('./moduleFileName');
```

---

## Self-Written Modules - Usage

```javascript
const myModule = require('./moduleFileName');
myModule.myFunction();
```

---

## Built-in Modules

Built-in modules are provided by JavaScript and can be used without additional installation.

---

## Built-in Modules - List

- `fs` - File system module
- `path` - Path module
- `os` - Operating system module
- `util` - Utility module
- `events` - Events module
- `http` - HTTP module
- `crypto` - Cryptography module
- `zlib` - Zlib module
- `stream` - Stream module
- ...

---

## Built-in Modules - Importing

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
```

---

## Built-in Modules - Usage

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const file = fs.readFileSync('file.txt', 'utf8');
```

---

## Third-Party Modules

Third-party modules are written by someone else and can be used in your project.

---

## NPM - Node Package Manager

- A registry for Node modules
- <https://www.npmjs.com/>

---

## Third-Party Modules - `package.json` File

The `package.json` file contains all the project-related information, including third-party modules (dependencies).

---

## Third-Party Modules - Creating a `package.json` File.

```bash
npm init -y
```

---

## Third-Party Modules - Installation

```bash
npm install moduleName
```

For example:

```bash
npm install prompt-sync
```

---

## Third-Party Modules - Usage

```javascript
const prompts = require('prompt-sync');

const prompt = prompts();

const name = prompt('Enter your name: ');

console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);

```

---

## `node_modules` Folder

All third-party modules are stored in the `node_modules` folder.

---

## `.gitignore` File

The `node_modules` folder should be added to the `.gitignore` file so it is not uploaded to the remote server.

---

## Creating a `.gitignore` File

```bash
node_modules/
```

---

## Reinstalling Dependencies

When copying your project to another machine, all dependencies need to be reinstalled.

```bash
npm install
```

---
