# Ninth Lecture

After recalling the topics from previous lectures and providing feedback on the homework assignments, we will continue with software development topics, where we will discuss code quality and how to improve it using simple tools. Then, we will move on to programming, where we will talk about how to make Node development a bit more convenient, how to read and write files, and what synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript code means.
