---

## Software Development Models

Software development models are structured approaches to software development that define the stages and processes to follow in software production. These models can be linear, sequential, or iterative, depending on the project's nature and requirements.

---

## Software Development Models - Discussion

---

## Software Development Models - Waterfall Model

- **Description:** A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. This is the earliest SDLC approach.
- **Advantages:** Clear structure, easy to understand, well-defined stages.
- **Disadvantages:** Difficult to make changes after a phase is completed, unsuitable for complex projects.

---

## Software Development Models - Agile Model

- **Description:** An iterative approach to software delivery that builds software incrementally, focusing on customer feedback and rapid iterations.
- **Advantages:** Flexible, promotes iterative feedback, encourages customer involvement.
- **Disadvantages:** Less predictable, may be difficult to understand for those used to traditional methods.

---

## Software Development Models - Kanban

- **Description:** A visual process management approach that draws inspiration from lean manufacturing and emphasizes just-in-time delivery.
- **Advantages:** Flexibility, continuous delivery, visual nature helps identify bottlenecks.
- **Disadvantages:** Less structured, can lead to overload if not properly managed.

---

## Software Development Models - Scrum

- **Description:** A type of agile methodology that organizes work into cycles called "Sprints," typically lasting 2-4 weeks.

## Issues and Observations from Homework

- Homework in separate files
  - Homework will now be assigned via `Issues`
- `let` vs `const`
- Checking ranges
- Logical operations
- How does the `%` operator behave?
- Magic numbers

---

## Algorithms - Discussion

---

## Algorithms

An algorithm is a defined, clearly structured set of instructions or a step-by-step process to perform a task or solve a problem.

---

## Algorithms - How to Start?

- Understand the problem
- Identify inputs and outputs
- Identify the steps required to solve the problem
- Write the algorithm in pseudocode or draw a flowchart
- Test the algorithm with different inputs
- Improve the algorithm if needed

---

## Algorithms - Pseudocode 1

Pseudocode is a simple, informal language used to describe the steps of an algorithm. It is not an actual programming language, but it can resemble one. Pseudocode is used to describe the steps of an algorithm in a way that is easy to understand.

---

## Algorithms - Pseudocode 2
```bash
START
READ number1
READ number2
sum = number1 + number2
PRINT sum
END
```
---

## Truthiness

When discussing truthiness in programming, it refers to whether an expression evaluates to true or false. We use truthiness to determine whether a condition is true or false when making decisions. 

---
## Truthiness exaple: 

```javascript
console.log(5 > 3); // true
console.log(5 < 3); // false
```

---
## Truthiness - Not a Boolean?

```javascript
let number = 5;

if (number) {
  console.log('The number is true');
} else {
  console.log('The number is false');
}
```
---
## Type Conversion of Falsy Values

- **null** - absence of a value
- **undefined** - absence of a value
- **false** - false
- **NaN** - Not a Number
- **0** - null
- **-0** - negative null
- **0n** - BigInt null
- **''** - empty string

---
## Why is Type Conversion Important?

```javascript
if (username && password) {
  console.log('Username and password are defined');
} else {
  console.log('Username and/or password are undefined');
}
```
---

## Logical Expressions Table

| `A` | `B` | `A && B` | `A \|\| B` | `!A` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| false | false | false | false | true |
| false | true  | false | true  | true |
| true  | false | false | true  | false |
| true  | true  | true  | true  | false |

---

## Arrays

An array is a collection of values stored in a single variable. Arrays are typically used to store related sets of data.

---

## Declaring an Array
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const fruits = ['apple', 'pear', 'banana'];
const mixed = [1, 'apple', true];
```

---

## Accessing Array Elements

- Each element has its own index (position number)
- Index starts at zero
- Access an element: `array[index]`
- Array length: `array.length`

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(numbers[0]); // 1

console.log(numbers.length); // 3
```

## Loops - Discussion

---

## Loops - Types

- `for`
- `while`
- `do...while`

---
## `for` Loop

A `for` loop is used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times. The for loop consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.
---

## `for` Loop Syntax

```js
for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
  // code to repeat
}

```

---

## `for` Loop Example

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

```

---

## `while` loop

A `while` loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. The while loop consists of a condition and a code block.

---

## `while` Loop Syntax

```js
while (condition) {
  // code to repeat
}

```

---

## `while` Loop - Important!

The `while` loop does not have a built-in initialization or increment/decrement part. Therefore, we need to be careful when using the `while` loop, as failing to update the counter can cause an infinite loop.

---

## `while` Loop Example

```js
let i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

```

---

## `do...while` Loop

The `do...while` loop is another type of loop used to repeat a block of code as long as a certain condition is true.

The difference from previous loops is that with the other loops, the condition is checked before executing the block of code, but in the `do...while` loop, the condition is checked after the code block is executed. This means that the code block in a `do...while` loop will always execute at least once, even if the condition is false.

---

## `do...while` Loop Syntax

```js
do {
  // code to repeat
} while (condition);

```

---

## `do...while` Loop Example
```js
let i = 0;

do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);

```
