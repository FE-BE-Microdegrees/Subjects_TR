## Recap of the Previous Lecture

---

## Issues During Homework

---

## Requirements and User Research

- What?
- Why?
- How?

---

## Brief

---

## Brief - What?

In the context of website creation, a brief is a document or guide that contains all the necessary information and requirements so that developers, designers, and other stakeholders can understand what is expected from the web project.

---

## Brief - In Short

- A brief description of the website's goal, requirements, and timeline;
- Provides all parties with a clear, common understanding of project expectations;
- Usually, the brief is prepared by the website's client;
- A thorough and clear brief ensures the project's success.

---

## What Does the Brief Contain?

- Company description
- Project scope
- Project goals
- Target audience definition
- Key competitors
- Technical requirements
- Timeline and budget
- Agreement documentation
- Launch and maintenance

---

## Brief - Discussion

Creating a blog environment

---

## Persona

---

## Persona - What?

In the context of software development and user experience design, a **persona** is a fictional character representing a specific type of user.

---

## Persona - Why?

A **persona** is created based on research and data about real users, and it helps designers and developers understand their users' needs, goals, and behaviors.

---

## Persona - Example

![Persona](https://github.com/FE-BE-Microdegrees/Subjects/blob/Slides-translation/Software-Development/Topics/Persona/persona_2.png)

---

## Persona - What Does it Contain?

- User demographics (e.g., age, gender, occupation)
- Details about their interests, motivations, and behaviors
- Information about their goals, frustrations, and pain points
- Details about their preferred methods of interaction with the software or application

---

## Persona - In Short

- A sample user, an archetype of the typical end-user, representing a specific user group;
- Created to better understand the customer—what motivates them, frustrates them, and what they need;
- It doesn't replace user research, but is based on it!
- Helps keep the end user's needs in mind during design, e.g., distinguishing important functionalities from unimportant ones.

---

## Persona - Creation

To create a persona, a team usually gathers information through research methods such as:

- Surveys;
- Interviews;
- Observations of real users.

This information is then used to create a fictional character that embodies the key characteristics of the target audience.

---

## Types of Personas

- **Proto-persona**: Based on existing assumptions rather than new research. The goal is to quickly sketch or provide an overview of existing expectations.
- **Qualitative Persona**: Based on small-scale research (e.g., interviews, observations). The goal is to deeply understand the customers!
- **Quantitative Persona**: Based on large-scale research (e.g., statistics, surveys). The goal is to personalize the data!

---

## Persona - Exercise

Create at least one persona for a user of the blogging environment.

You can use some online tools, such as:

- UXPressia
- HubSpot

Or simply use paper.

---

## User Stories

---

## User Stories 1

A user story is a simple one-sentence description of a software application feature or functionality written from the perspective of the end-user.

---

## User Stories 2

User stories are a common technique used in agile software development to describe application requirements in a way that is easy to understand and prioritize.

---

## User Stories - Example

`As a registered user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account in case I forget my password.`

---

## User Stories - Writing

- Identify the user
- Describe the action
- Name the benefit
- Prioritize

---

## User Stories - Example 2

1. As a guest user, I want to browse products so that I can find something to purchase.
2. As a registered user, I want to add items to my cart so that I can keep track of what I want to buy.
3. As a registered user, I want to be able to pay for my goods so that I can complete my purchase.

---

## User Stories - Exercise

Assume that a client wants to order an environment for blogging.

Write user stories in a separate document about what potential users would want to do in the environment.

---

## Scenario

---

## Scenario - What?

In software development, a scenario refers to a specific use case or situation that a user may encounter while interacting with the software.

---

## Scenario - Why?

Scenarios are used to describe how users interact with software and the steps they need to take to complete a specific task or goal.

Scenarios are often created during the requirement gathering phase of software development and are used to define functional and non-functional software requirements.

---

## Scenario - Example

| Actor | Tiina.. |
| --- | --- |
| Motivation | ..wants to learn how to create a website for her business by herself |
| Goal | She wants to find a training course that is affordable, aimed at beginners, and available at convenient dates |
| Action | Tiina selects a suitable category from the list of courses, in this case, IT. Then, she sorts the courses by price and date and reviews their content |
| Outcome | She finds a suitable course from the list and registers as a participant |

---

## Scenario Guidelines

- Avoid over-describing technology or design—the goal of the scenario is to inspire design, not fixate on it!
- Don't overly detail the persona and their goals; focus only on what's essential!

---

## Scenario - In Short

- A persona-based description of using the product/service;
- It does not focus on business or technical details or design but rather describes the user experience!
- Includes:
  - actor;
  - motivation;
  - goal or intention;
  - action;
  - outcome or solution.

---

## Scenario - Exercise

Create at least one scenario for a user of the blogging environment.

---

## User Journey

A user journey, also known as a user journey map or customer journey map, is a tool used in software development to visualize a user's experience when interacting with a product or service.

---

## User Journey - Example

![User Journey](https://github.com/FE-BE-Microdegrees/Subjects/blob/Slides-translation/Software-Development/Topics/User-Journey/Kasutajateekond_1.png)

---

## User Journey Mapping

A typical user journey may involve several key stages, such as:

- Awareness
- Research
- Sign-up or purchase
- Onboarding
- Use
- Support
- Renewal or cancellation

---

## User Journey - In Short

- An alternative or extension to the scenario, providing a complete overview of the user experience;
- The first step is identifying the persona and scenario, as well as the goals.
- The second part focuses on the visual representation of the experience, divided into multiple stages.
- The third part consists of observations, further opportunities, and responsible parties.

## Programming

- [Functions](../../../Subjects/Programming-Basics/Topics/Functions/README.md)

## Recap of the Previous Lecture

---

## Issues During Homework

---

## Function - What?

A function is a reusable block of code intended to perform a specific task.

Functions are used to organize code into logical units that can be reused throughout the program.

---

## Function - Example

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  const sum = a + b;
  return sum;
}
```

---

## Function - Consists of

- Function - Consists of
- Function name
- Function parameters (optional)
- Function body
- Return statement (optional)
- Return value (optional)

---

## Function Declaration

In JavaScript, we can declare functions in two ways:

- Function declaration;
- Function expression.

---

## Function Declaration

```javascript
function functionName(parameter1, parameter2) {
  // function body
  return value;
}
```

---

## Function Expression

```javascript
const add = function(a, b) {
  const sum = a + b;
  return sum;
}
```

---

## Function Invocation (Execution)

```javascript
const sum = add(1, 2);

console.log(sum); // 3
```
