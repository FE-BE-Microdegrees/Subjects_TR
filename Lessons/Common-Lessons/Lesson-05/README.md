# Fifth Lecture

As has become usual, we will start by recalling the previous lectures and providing feedback on the homework assignments. We will continue with topics in software development, discussing requirements and user research.

On the programming side, we will talk about functions and some of the most commonly used JavaScript built-in functions.
