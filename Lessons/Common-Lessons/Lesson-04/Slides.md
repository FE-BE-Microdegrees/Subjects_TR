## Documentation - What Is It?

In software development, documentation refers to written materials that describe the functions, architecture, design, or usage of a software solution. It includes all the data needed to understand, interact with, and maintain the software.

---

## Documentation - Why Is It Important?

- Knowledge retention
- Ease of use
- Consistency
- Diagnosing issues
- etc.

---

## Types of Documentation

- Requirements documentation
- Technical documentation
- User manuals
- Architecture and design documentation
- Testing documentation
- Maintenance and support guides
- Process documentation
- API (Application Programming Interface) documentation

---

## Creating Documentation

- Determine the purpose and scope of the documentation
- Plan the documentation
- Write the documentation
- Test and review the documentation
- Update and maintain the documentation

## Data Structures (Objects)

An object is a collection of key-value pairs stored in a single variable. Objects are used when we need to store information consisting of multiple properties. For example, we can use an object to store information about a person (first name, last name, age, address, etc.).

---

## Object

```js
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  age: 25
};

```
