#### Homework Assignment

Analyze a blog and consider what the structure of your blog page might look like:

- What data should be displayed, and where should it be positioned?
- What pages should the blog have?
- Any other relevant ideas.

If necessary, sketch your planned page on paper or use a design tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

Create HTML and CSS files and begin building your planned page. Initially, it’s enough to simply add elements with content (e.g., posts, comments, etc.) to the HTML file and start structuring the page with CSS. At this stage, creating an exact replica of your envisioned page might be challenging, but that’s not the goal. The aim is to practice using HTML and CSS and to think about how to design a page that meets your needs.
