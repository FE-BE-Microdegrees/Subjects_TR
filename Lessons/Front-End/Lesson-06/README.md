#### Homework Assignment

- Try redesigning your blog homepage using React. Aim to incorporate React Bootstrap where possible.

The goal is for you to understand how to get started with React, how components work, and how to use them.

For now, focus on creating the homepage. We'll cover how to set up multiple pages in React and how to navigate between them in the next lecture.
