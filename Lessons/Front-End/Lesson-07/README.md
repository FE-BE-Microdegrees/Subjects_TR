# Lecture Seven

As per tradition, we will start by reviewing what we discussed and did in the previous lecture. Then, we will cover React Router, specifically how to create multi-page web applications in React. Among other things, we’ll look at how to handle situations where a user tries to access a page that does not exist on the site. Finally, we’ll discuss React Forms—how to use HTML forms with React, read from them, and manage them.
