# Tenth Lecture

We have reached the final lecture of this course. As usual, we will start by reviewing the previous lecture, and then we’ll discuss Pagination, which allows for fetching and displaying data in pages. Finally, we will look at how to deploy a React application to the internet using GitHub Pages.

After covering these topics, we’ll wrap up the course, discuss topics we did not cover during the course, and share feedback on how the course went.

Before the lecture, please download the prepared [code for this lecture](code/10.zip) and ensure it runs correctly.
