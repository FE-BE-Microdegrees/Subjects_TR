# Eighth Lecture

As usual, we’ll start by reviewing what we covered in the previous lecture. Then, we’ll explore how to fetch data from an external source in our application using `axios`. Next, we’ll learn about the React component lifecycle and how to manage it with the `useEffect` hook. We’ll also discuss dynamic routes—how to set up routes with dynamic addresses. After that, we’ll cover conditional rendering for displaying and hiding components. Finally, we’ll touch on flash messages—what they are and how to create and use them.

In the lecture, we’ll use prepared code to ensure everyone has a similar setup, making it easier to learn and practice together. To speed up the lecture, please download the code for this session [here](./code/blog.zip) beforehand, extract it to your computer, install dependencies, and ensure the application runs.

Instructions:

- Download the `zip` file to your computer
- Extract the file
- Open it in your code editor (e.g., VS Code)
- Open the folder in the terminal and run `npm install` in the root directory
- Start the application with `npm start`

If you encounter issues, contact the instructor.
