# Front-End Frameworks

"Front-end Frameworks" introduces the paradigms and practices of current web development frameworks that drive the interactive web applications of today. Students will grasp foundational concepts such as components, data-binding, and reactive programming. Advanced topics, including routing, global state management, and server-side rendering, further deepen the coursework. Beyond just the technical, students will also explore the design patterns and best practices specific to front-end frameworks. This comprehensive subject culminates in hands-on projects where students craft scalable and interactive web applications, familiarizing themselves with the extensive tooling and ecosystem inherent to cutting-edge front-end development.

## Description

- **Volume**: 4 ECTS (4 x 26 hours)
- **Subject Aims**: The aim of the "Front-end Frameworks" subject is to empower students with the expertise needed to harness modern front-end frameworks for the development of dynamic, efficient, and user-centric web applications.

By the end of the course, students should be proficient in the principles of component-based architecture, state management, and the broader ecosystem of tools and extensions associated with contemporary front-end development.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Understand and implement component-based architectures, enabling the creation of reusable UI components for scalable application design.
- **Reactive Programming**: Demonstrate the principles of reactive programming, using data-binding mechanisms to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Routing and Navigation**: Implement client-side routing to build single-page applications (SPAs) with multiple views and navigation.
- **State Management**: Employ global state management strategies to manage and synchronize application data across components.
- **Framework Tooling**: Utilize the build tools, CLI interfaces, and other utilities provided by modern front-end frameworks to streamline development and deployment.
- **Integration with Back-end Services**: Connect front-end applications with back-end services and APIs, understanding concepts like asynchronous operations, promises, and fetch.
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Design and develop applications that are responsive across a variety of devices and screen sizes using framework-specific techniques and utilities.
- **Testing and Validation**: Integrate unit and integration testing tools provided by the framework ecosystem to ensure the reliability and stability of the application.
- **Security Practices**: Understand and implement security best practices in front-end applications, safeguarding against common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Framework Ecosystem**: Navigate and incorporate plugins, libraries, and extensions from the wider ecosystem of the studied front-end framework to extend functionality and improve development workflows.
