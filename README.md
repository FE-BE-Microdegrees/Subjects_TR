# Subjects

This repository contains the subjects for [Front-End Microdegree](https://github.com/FE-BE-Microdegrees/Front-End-Microdegree) and [Back-End Microdegree](https://github.com/FE-BE-Microdegrees/Back-End-Microdegree).

## Front-End Microdegree subjects:

- [Software Development](./Software-Development/README.md)
- [Programming Basics](./Programming-Basics/README.md)
- [Front-End Technologies](./Front-End-Technologies/README.md)
- [Front-End Frameworks](./Front-End-Frameworks/README.md)

## Back-End Microdegree subjects:

- [Software Development](./Software-Development/README.md)
- [Programming Basics](./Programming-Basics/README.md)
- [Back-End Frameworks](./Back-End-Frameworks/README.md)
- [Databases](./Databases/README.md)

Both microdegrees share the same subjects for *Software Development* and *Programming Basics* and differ in the other two subjects. The **Front-End Microdegree** has *Front-End Technologies* and *Front-End Frameworks*, while the **Back-End Microdegree** has *Back-End Frameworks* and *Databases* subjects. First two subjects are the same for both microdegrees because they are the foundation for both front-end and back-end development.
