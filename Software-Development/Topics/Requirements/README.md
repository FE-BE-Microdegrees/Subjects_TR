# Requirements

In this topic we'll explore the concepts of software requirements - what they are, why they're important, and how to write them.

## What are Software Requirements?

Software requirements are the *functional* and *non-functional* requirements that define the scope of a software project. Requirements are a key part of the software development process, and they're important to get right. Requirements describe the expected behavior of the software, and they're used to guide the development process.

**Functional** requirements describe what the software should do. They're the features and functionality that the software should have. For example, a functional requirement might be:
- `the software should allow users to log in`;
- `the software should allow users to change their password`;
- `the software should allow users to reset their password`.

**Non-functional** requirements describe how the software should do it. They're the constraints and limitations that the software should have (including technical requirement). For example, a non-functional requirement might be:
- `the software should be able to handle 1000 concurrent users`;
- `the software should use bcrypt to hash passwords`;
- `the software should be able to run on Linux, Windows, and macOS`.

Requirements can be described in different levels of detail. For example, a high-level requirement might be
- `the software should allow users to log in`.

A more detailed requirement might be
- `the software should allow users to log in with their email address and password`.

A very detailed requirement might be
- `the software should allow users to log in with their email address and password, and it should use bcrypt to hash the password before storing it in the database`.

### User Requirements vs System Requirements

We can also categorize requirements as *user* requirements or *system* requirements.

**User requirements** describe what the user wants the software to do. Users requirements can be written using the user's own words with possible diagrams and pictures about what system should do or look like. It would be written in user's perspective.

**System requirements** describe what the system needs to do to meet the user requirements.This is more detailed description about system functionality, interfaces and performance and what exactly would be needed to meet user requirements. It is more technical description of what system should do.

> There are lot of different ways to categorize or describe requirements. The most important thing is to write them down and make sure that they are clear and understandable.
>
> We should always validate our requirements with our users and stakeholders. We should always make sure that we understand what they want and need, and that they understand what we're building.

## How to develop Software Requirements?

During the development of requirements, information is collected about the software to be created and the existing (working in real life) system.

User requirements and system requirements are created using collected information. The following activities are performed for this purpose:
- documents related to the field are consulted;
- communicating with the interest group;
- similar systems are studied.

### Stakeholders

Stakeholders are the people who have an interest in the software. They can be:
- users;
- customers;
- managers;
- business analysts;
- ...
