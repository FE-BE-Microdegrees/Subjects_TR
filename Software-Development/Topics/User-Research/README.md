# User Research

In this topic, we'll explore the concepts of user research - what it is, why it's important, and how to do it.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this topic, you should be able to:

- understand the concept of user research;
- identify the different types of user research;
- describe the importance of user research.

## What is User Research?

We all have our own experiences, opinions, and biases. When we're building software, it's important to remember that we're not building it for ourselves, we're building it for our users. And the only way to know what our users want and need is to ask them. That's where user research comes in.

**It is very important to remember, that we can't build software for other people without understanding their needs and wants.**

User research is the process of understanding the needs, wants, and behaviors of your users. It's a critical part of the software development process, and it's important to do it early and often.

The easiest way to do user research is to talk to your users. Ask them questions about what they want, what they need, and how they use your software. You can also observe them using your software, and see what they do and how they do it.

In short, user research is the process of understanding your users, and using that understanding to build better software.

To do that, we can do a number of things, including:

- User Interviews
- Surveys and Questionnaires
- Observations
- ...

Before we start building software, we also can use some of the following techniques to understand our users and what they expect from our software:

- User Stories
- User Persona Development
- User Journey Mapping
- User Flow Mapping
- User Testing
- ...

We have to understand, that during this course we will not be able to cover all of these topics in depth. We will only scratch the surface of these topics, but we will try to give you a good overview of what these topics are and how they can be used in software development.
