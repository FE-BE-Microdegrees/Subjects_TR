# User Stories

In this topic we'll discuss the concept of user stories - what they are, why they're important, and how to write them.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this topic you should be able to:
- Define user stories and explain their importance in software development.
- Write user stories for a given software project.
- Prioritize user stories using the MoSCoW method.


## What is a User Story?

A user story is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:

As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].

For example:

- As a user, I want to be able to log in so that I can access my account.
- As a customer, I want to be able to pay my bill online so that I don't have to mail a check.
- As a user, I want to be able to search for a product so that I can find what I'm looking for.

The goal of a user story is to describe a feature in a way that is easy to understand and that can be easily translated into a test case. They are typically written on index cards or sticky notes, and are often arranged on a wall or whiteboard to facilitate planning and discussion.

## How to Write a User Story

To write a User Story, You can follow the following steps:

1. Identify your users - start with indentifying user or role, from whose perspective you are writing the story. It can be specific user or group of users, who have similar needs and goals.
2. Describe the action - describe what the user wants to do. It should be short and simple.
3. Describe the goal - describe the benefit or value that the user will get from the action. It should describe why the user wants to do the action and what they will get from it.

> User Stories should be short and simple and they should focus on the user and their needs.
>
> User Stories should be written simply and clearly, so that they can be easily understood by everyone involved in the project.

## Prioritizing User Stories

User Stories are typically prioritized based on their importance to the user. The most important stories are those that provide the most value to the user, and the least important stories are those that provide the least value, so that the team can focus on the most important stories first.

There are many ways to prioritize user stories, but one of the most common is the MoSCoW method. MosCoW is an acronym for Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have. These are the four categories that user stories are typically placed in, based on their importance to the user.

- **Must Have:** These are the most important stories, and they must be completed for the project to be considered a success.
- **Should Have:** These are important stories, but they are not essential. They should be completed if possible, but they can be left out if necessary.
- **Could Have:** These are nice-to-have stories, but they are not essential. They can be completed if there is time, but they can also be left out if necessary.
- **Won't Have:** These are stories that are not essential, and they will not be completed for this project.

## Example:

Let's consider some example user stories for a school lesson schedule software, categorized using the MoSCoW method:

### Must Have (M)
These are critical requirements that the software must meet for it to be successful.
1. **As a teacher, I must be able to view my weekly schedule so that I know my teaching timetable.**
2. **As a student, I must be able to access my class schedule for the current semester to organize my study time.**
3. **As an administrator, I must be able to update the schedule for any class in case of changes in teacher availability or classroom assignments.**

### Should Have (S)
These are important but not critical; the project can be viable even if some of these are not included in the first release.

1. **As a teacher, I should be able to request a change in my schedule to accommodate personal commitments.**
2. **As a student, I should receive notifications if any of my scheduled classes are changed or cancelled.**
3. **As an administrator, I should be able to generate reports on classroom utilization to optimize space usage.**

### Could Have (C)
These are desirable features which are not vital. They could improve user experience or software functionality but are not essential.

1. **As a teacher, I could have the ability to sync my school schedule with my personal calendar for better planning.**
2. **As a student, I could have a feature to integrate the school schedule with study planning tools.**
3. **As an administrator, I could have analytics to monitor attendance trends and adjust schedules accordingly.**

### Won't Have (W)
These are features that have been recognized but will not be implemented in the current project cycle.

1. **As a teacher, I won't have the ability to directly modify the overall school schedule, only to request changes.**
2. **As a student, I won't have the option to customize the visual layout of my schedule in the first version.**
3. **As an administrator, I won't have real-time tracking of each student's attendance in the initial release.**

This categorization helps in focusing on what is essential for the software to be functional and valuable, while identifying what can be added later or omitted as per resource availability and project constraints.

Now it is easy to convert these user stories into tasks and plan the project accordingly.
