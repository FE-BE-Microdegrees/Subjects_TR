By the end of this topic you should be able to:

- Define what is software.
- Describe the different types of software.
- Explain the difference between open source and proprietary software.
- Explain the software development process.

## What is Software?

To start with Software Development, we need to understand what is software. Software is a set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. It can be a program, an application, or a system. Software is what makes computers useful. Without software, computers would be nothing more than expensive paperweights.

We can classify software into two main categories:

- **System Software:** System software is software that manages and controls the hardware components of a computer system. It includes operating systems, device drivers, utilities, and other tools that help manage the computer system. System software is essential for the computer to function properly. Examples of system software include
  - **Windows**
  - **macOS**
  - **Linux**
  - **Android**
  - **iOS**

- **Application Software:** Application software is software that performs a specific task or set of tasks. It includes programs such as word processors, spreadsheets, web browsers, and games. Application software is what most people think of when they think of software. Examples of application software include
  - **Microsoft Word**
  - **Google Chrome**
  - **Adobe Photoshop**
  - **Minecraft**
    
 Additionally, various web applications, mobile applications, and other specific software solutions created for specific tasks can also be considered as application software.

## Open Source Software vs Proprietary Software

Software can also be classified as open source or proprietary. Open source software is software that is freely available and can be modified and redistributed by anyone. Proprietary software is software that is owned by a company or individual and cannot be modified or redistributed without permission.

Examples of open source software include 
- **Linux**
- **Firefox**
- **WordPress**

 Examples of proprietary software include 
 - **Microsoft Windows**
 - **Adobe Photoshop**
 -  **Apple iOS**.

|                         | Open Source Software                                            | Proprietary Software |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Accessibility           | Accessible to all, its source code is freely available for viewing, modifying, and distributing | Accessible only to those who have purchased a license or have permission from the owner to use it |
| Licensing               | Typically licensed under open source licenses, allowing everyone to use, modify, and distribute the software as long as they comply with the license terms | Typically licensed under proprietary licenses, which limit the use, modification, and distribution of the software |
| Development             | Often developed collaboratively with contributions from a community of developers | Typically developed by a single company or group of developers |
| Cost                    | Often available for free, although some companies/developers may charge for support or additional services | Usually requires a license fee or purchase cost |
| Support                 | Often relies on a community of developers, although some companies/developers may also offer paid support services | Usually provided for free or for a fee directly by the company that owns the software |
| Customization           | Open source software offers greater flexibility in customization, as users can modify the source code according to their needs | Proprietary software may offer limited customization options |

In conclusion, open source and proprietary software have their own advantages and disadvantages. Open source software is often free and offers greater flexibility in customization, but it may not be as reliable or secure as proprietary software. Proprietary software is often more reliable and secure, but it may not be as flexible or customizable as open source software.

## Where does Software Come From?

Software is created by software developers. Software developers are people who write code to create software. They are also known as programmers or coders. Software developers use programming languages to write code. Programming languages are formal languages that can be translated into machine code (i.e., binary) and executed by a computer.

There are many different programming languages, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. Some of them are considered easier to learn than others, while some are more powerful and flexible. Some of the most popular programming languages include 
- [**JavaScript**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/)
- [**C#**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/csharp)
- [**Java**](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_intro.asp)
- [**C**](https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_intro.php?external_link=true)
- [**C++**](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_intro.asp)
- etc.

It is important to note that a choice of programming language is not always a matter of personal preference. Some programming languages are better suited for certain tasks than others. For example, JavaScript is a popular programming language for web development, while Python is a popular programming language for data science and machine learning. It could also depend on the type of hardware or operating system that the software will run on.

## What is Software Development?

First and foremost, it's important to note that software development is not synonymous with programming. While software development involves writing code, it is much more than just writing code.

Software development is the process of creating software. It includes:

- analyzing user needs;
- designing software solutions;
- writing code;
- testing software;
- deploying software
- etc.
  
Software development is a complex process that requires a lot of planning and coordination. It typically takes place in a team of software developers, where each member has a specific role.
