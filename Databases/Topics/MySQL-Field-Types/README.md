## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this chapter, learners should be able to:

- Explain the various MySQL data types and their properties;
- Choose appropriate data types based on the nature of the data;
- Use different data types while creating and modifying MySQL tables.

## MySQL Data Types

MySQL field types can be categorized into the following groups:

- Numeric data types
- Date and time data types
- Text data types
- Binary data types
- Other data types

### Numeric Data Types

Numeric data types are used to store numerical data. These can be further divided into integers and floating-point numbers.

#### Integers

- **TINYINT:** Very small integer (range: -128 to 127).
- **SMALLINT:** Small integer (range: -32,768 to 32,767).
- **MEDIUMINT:** Medium-sized integer (range: -8,388,608 to 8,388,607).
- **INT or INTEGER:** Regular integer (range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647).
- **BIGINT:** Large integer (range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807).

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Numbers (
    small_num SMALLINT,
    medium_num MEDIUMINT,
    large_num BIGINT
);
```

#### Floating-Point Numbers

- **FLOAT:** Floating-point number with lower precision.
- **DOUBLE:** Floating-point number with higher precision.
- **DECIMAL or NUMERIC:**  Fixed-point number with a defined precision and scale.

NÃ¤ide:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Prices (
    price_float FLOAT,
    price_double DOUBLE,
    price_decimal DECIMAL(10, 2)
);
```

### Date and Time Data Types

Date and time data types are used to store temporal data.

- **DATE:** Date (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
- **TIME:** Time (format: HH:MI:SS).
- **DATETIME:** Date and time (combined format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS).
- **TIMESTAMP:** Timestamp (stored in UTC).
- **YEAR:** Year (format: YYYY).

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Events (
    event_date DATE,
    event_time TIME,
    event_timestamp TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Text Data Types

Text data types are used to store strings of letters and numbers.

- **CHAR:** Fixed-length string (up to 255 characters).
- **VARCHAR:** Variable-length string (up to 65,535 characters).
- **TINYTEXT:** Very small text (up to 255 characters).
- **TEXT:** Small text (up to 65,535 characters).
- **MEDIUMTEXT:** Medium-sized text (up to 16,777,215 characters).
- **LONGTEXT:** Large text (up to 4,294,967,295 characters).

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Messages (
    message_short CHAR(50),
    message_long TEXT
);
```

### Binary Data Types

Binary data types are used to store binary data, such as images or files.

- **BINARY:** Fixed-length binary string.
- **VARBINARY:** Variable-length binary string.
- **TINYBLOB:** Small binary object (up to 255 bytes).
- **BLOB:** Binary object (up to 65,535 bytes)
- **MEDIUMBLOB:** Medium-sized binary object (up to 16,777,215 bytes).
- **LONGBLOB:** Large binary object (up to 4,294,967,295 bytes).

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Files (
    file_name VARCHAR(255),
    file_data BLOB
);
```

### Other Data Types

- **ENUM:** Enumerated type, allowing one value from a defined list.
- **SET:** Set type, allowing zero or more values from a defined list.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    product_status ENUM('available', 'out_of_stock', 'discontinued')
);
```

## Additional Field Attributes

Fields can include various attributes that define constraints and behavior. Common field attributes include:

- `NOT NULL`: Ensures the value cannot be NULL.
- `UNIQUE`: Ensures the value is unique.
- `DEFAULT value`: Specifies a default value if none is provided.
- `AUTO_INCREMENT`: Automatically increments the column value for each new row.
- `PRIMARY KEY`: A unique identifier for each record.
- `FOREIGN KEY`: Defines relationships between tables.
- ...

## Review Questions or Exercises

- What are MySQL data types, and why are they important?
- Write an SQL command to create a table named "Employees" with the following columns: ID (primary key, integer), Name (variable character string, max 100 characters), Position (fixed character string, 50 characters), Salary (decimal number with 10 digits and 2 decimal places).
- Which MySQL data type is most suitable for storing large text documents? Write an example.
-Write an SQL command to create a table "Orders" with the following columns: OrderID (primary key, integer), OrderDate (date), TotalAmount (decimal number with 10 digits and 2 decimal places).

## Exercise

- Create a new database named "Library".
- Create a table named "Books" with the following columns: ID (primary key, integer), Title (variable character string, max 255 characters), Author (variable character string, max 100 characters), PublishedYear (year), Genre (enum with values 'Fiction', 'Non-Fiction', 'Sci-Fi', 'Biography'), CoverImage (blob).
- Insert three sample records into the "Books" table.
- Write an SQL query to select all books published after the year 2000.
