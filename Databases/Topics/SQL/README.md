## What is SQL?

SQL is a declarative language that is used to manage data in relational databases. It is used to create, read, update, and delete data in relational databases. It is also used to create and modify the structure of relational databases. SQL is a declarative language, that means that we don't need to specify how to do something, we only need to specify what to do. SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating data in relational databases.

Relational databases are databases that store data in tables. Each table has a name and consists of rows and columns. Each row in a table represents a record and each column in a table represents a field. Each record in a table has (usually, but not always) a unique identifier called a primary key. The primary key is used to identify a record in a table. Each field in a table has a data type. The data type of a field determines what kind of data can be stored in that field. For example, if a field has a data type of `int`, it can only store integers. If a field has a data type of `varchar`, it can store any kind of data.

## History of SQL

SQL was developed by IBM in the 1970s. It was originally called SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language). It was later renamed to SQL (Structured Query Language). SQL was first standardized in 1986 by ANSI (American National Standards Institute). It was later standardized by ISO (International Organization for Standardization) in 1987. SQL has been revised several times since then. The latest version of SQL is SQL:2016.

## How to run SQL?

We can run SQL in a database management system (DBMS). A DBMS is a software application that is used to manage data in a database. There are many different DBMSs available, including `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `Oracle`, `Microsoft SQL Server`, and `SQLite`. We can use any of these DBMSs to run SQL.

In this course we'll use `MySQL` as our DBMS. MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is developed by Oracle Corporation. It is one of the most popular RDBMSs in the world. It is used by many companies, including `Facebook`, `Twitter`, and `Google`.

There are many different ways to run SQL in MySQL. For example, we can use:
- MySQL command-line client;
- MySQL Workbench;
- MySQL Connector/ODBC;
- etc.

During this course, we'll use MySQL Workbench to run SQL. MySQL Workbench is a graphical user interface (GUI) tool that is used to manage MySQL databases. It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
