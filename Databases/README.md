# Databases

## Description

"Database" delves deep into the realm of data storage, manipulation, and retrieval systems central to today's technological infrastructures. Students will learn foundational concepts like data models, normalization, and SQL. Through a blend of theoretical instruction and practical exercises, students will design and manage database systems, ensuring efficiency, scalability, and security in real-world scenarios.

- **Volume**: 4 ECTS (4 x 26 hours)
- **Subject Aims**: The aim of the "Database" subject is to provide students with foundational knowledge and hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and managing databases.

Upon completion, students should be adept at data modeling, understanding database architectures, optimizing queries, and ensuring data integrity and security in both relational and non-relational database systems.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Data Modeling**: Design and implement database schemas, understanding Entity-Relationship (ER) models, and normalization processes.
- **SQL Proficiency**: Formulate and execute SQL queries to create, read, update, and delete data in relational databases.
- **Database Architectures**: Differentiate between various database architectures, including relational, NoSQL, and distributed systems.
- **Security**: Implement security measures for databases, understanding concepts like authentication, authorization, encryption, and guarding against SQL injection.
- **Stored Procedures & Triggers**: Design and implement stored procedures and triggers to automate database operations.
- **Database Evolution**: Migrate and evolve database schemas over time while maintaining data integrity.
- **Real-world Applications**: Apply database concepts in real-world scenarios, understanding the role of databases in web applications, data analytics, and other modern technological contexts.
